Additionally, antioxidants can help to repair the damage that has already been done to cells. 3. Clears congested chest (expectorant) Cloves are a natural expectorant, which means they can help loosen and expel mucus from your lungs. Just add a few cloves to a cup of boiling water and let steep for 10 minutes.   You can sweeten it with honey if you like. Drink up and feel the congestion start to clear. 4. Reliefs stomach pains (analgesic and antimicrobial) The analgesic properties of cloves help to relieve pain and ease discomfort. Clove tea also acts as an antimicrobial, helping to kill harmful bacteria and protect the digestive system.   Drinking clove tea is a simple and effective way to reduce stomach pain and keep the digestive system healthy. 5. Protects against skin infection (antiseptic) When applied topically, clove tea has antifungal and antibacterial properties that can help to protect against skin infections.   Clove tea can also help to speed up the healing process of skin infections such as acne.  FAQs What are the benefits of drinking tea in the morning?

  <h3><strong>What Is Clove Tea?</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clove tea is made from cloves, the aromatic spice derived from the flower buds of the clove tree (Syzygium aromaticum). Known for its rich flavor and medicinal properties, cloves have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, especially in Asia.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloves are packed with eugenol, a compound known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties make clove tea an excellent choice for improving digestion, relieving pain, and even acting as a natural antiseptic.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while clove tea is widely celebrated for its health benefits, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand the possible side effects that come with it. Now, let&rsquo;s look at some common ones.</span></p>

  <h3><strong>Common Side Effects of Clove Tea</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though clove tea offers a range of health benefits, it&rsquo;s not without its potential risks. Here are a few common side effects you should be aware of before consuming clove tea regularly:</span></p>
  
  <h4><strong>Digestive Issues</strong></h4>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clove tea is known to help with indigestion and bloating. However, excessive consumption can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, or even heartburn. If you have a sensitive stomach, it&rsquo;s best to start with small amounts and see how your body reacts.</span></p>

  <h4><strong>Allergic Reactions</strong></h4>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people may be allergic to cloves, resulting in symptoms like rashes, swelling, or difficulty breathing. If you're prone to allergies, it&rsquo;s wise to consult a doctor before drinking clove tea.</span></p>

  <h4><strong>Liver Concerns</strong></h4>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clove oil, which is highly concentrated, can cause liver toxicity if consumed in large amounts. While the concentration in clove tea is much lower, it&rsquo;s still important to limit intake and avoid drinking large quantities regularly.</span></p>

  <h4><strong>Blood Pressure and Sugar Levels</strong></h4>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clove tea may affect blood pressure and blood sugar levels. If you're on medication for high blood pressure or diabetes, it&rsquo;s important to talk to your healthcare provider before using clove tea as a remedy.</span></p>

  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pregnancy</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Pregnant women should avoid consuming large amounts of clove tea, as it can stimulate uterine contractions.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Allergies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you're allergic to cloves or other spices in the same family, it&rsquo;s best to avoid clove tea to prevent allergic reactions.</span></li>
